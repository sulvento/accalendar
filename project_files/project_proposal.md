## 1. Project Overview

Accalendar is a calendar application that integrates directly with the Canvas API to better serve students.  

The application will:

- Support general calendar functionality (event creation, recurring events, etc.)
- Automatically fetch and import Canvas assignments
- Combine academic and personal schedules into one unified interface

The goal is to eliminate the need for students to manually transfer assignment deadlines from Canvas to personal calendar applications like Google Calendar or Outlook.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Canvas provides a built-in calendar, but it:

- Only includes posted Canvas assignments
- Does not allow flexible personal event management
- Requires students to manually manage multiple calendars

Students often switch between Canvas and other scheduling platforms. Accalendar solves this by creating automation and seamless integration between systems.

## 3. Target Stakeholders

Primary users:

- Students at institutions that use Canvas

Broader impact:

- K–12 institutions  
- Colleges and universities  
- Corporate entities using Canvas  

This tool is especially helpful for:

- Students managing multiple commitments  
- Neurodivergent individuals  
- Nontraditional students  
- Anyone who struggles with time management
